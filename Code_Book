# Variables
- x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
- x_dataset, y_dataset and subject_dataset merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
- features contains the correct names for the x_dataset dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in mean_std, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
- A similar approach is taken with activity names through the activities variable.
- singledata merges x_data, y_data and subject_data in a big dataset.
- The tidy_data.txt data file is a text file, containing space-separated values.


# Tidy Data
